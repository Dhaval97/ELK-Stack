How to install ELK-Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Filebeat)

ELK with Filebeat is known as ELK Stack.

### Description
* **ELK** is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
* **Elasticsearch** is a search and analytics engine.
* **Logstash** is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch.
* **Kibana** lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

### Filebeat
* Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.
